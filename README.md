# menorah_lamp
Menorah using addressable LEDs

# TODO
- Fill out this README
- Add some more color palettes
- Add a web UI
- Add other patterns, some ideas:
  - fan in
  - flicker (try to imitate candles)
  - fix blink
  - fade (constantly fade to the next color in the palette)
  - swap next (in order of lights, change that color, the fade all the rest to that new color, then
    change the next light in order followed by the other lights fading to
    that next color, repeat)
